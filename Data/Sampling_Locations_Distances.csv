5/22/2024,0,407,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,,,stream was connected throughout chanel (very low to little flow in parts but still wet in at least parts of channel ,
6/19/2024,0,330,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,340,586,Stream had dried between S2 and P1 (about 32ft above P1 and 10ft below S2,
7/11/2024,0,215,670,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,225,665,Stream had dried between S2 and P1: sampled a few down from where restarts (new P1) and a few feet above where water ended (new S2),
8/14/2024,0,215,775,805,1132,1843,3326,5011,225,760,"Stream had dried between S2 and P2: sampled same S2 as July 11; P1 sampled 15ft above P2 buoy, P2 sampled 15ft past P2 buoy (both only sampled at 0.1m); C1 had dried up",
9/16/2024,0,,,,1102,1843,3326,5011,3,1072,"Stream had dried at S1 well, but had pooled water ~3 ft above well, and small water to side of well about 5ft downstream of well; stream remained dry until ~ 60ft upstream of of the C2 buoy following the newly fomred stream channel. The C2 buoy had dried, so we had new sampling site ~30 ft upstream of the buoy (for both pratical sampling purpose and to be able to sample in new stream chanel)",
9/30/2024,0,407,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,,,"stream had fully connected from well to reservoir again; C1 was still dried; but all other sites were able to be sampled at their original GPS pins from May. Some spots of stream were still low and braided pattern, but flowwing water all the way from well to reservoir",
10/28/2024,0,265,649,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,270,644,stream had disconnected again: new S2 site (see GPS and picutres on other sheet) and rewetted ~25 ft down from original P1. ,
12/17/2024,0,407,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,,,"stream had fully connected again! Sites S1 - P2 were all very streamlike, C2 very shallow but start of cove like characteristics",
2/26/2025,0,407,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,,,stream fully connected still; P1 and P2 were pool like again. overflow at P sites; HOBO sensor gone at S1 ,
4/16/2025,0,407,619,790,1132,1843,3326,5011,,,stream fully connected; P1 and P2 pool like; some trees had made a weir above S1; under flow at P1 it looks,
